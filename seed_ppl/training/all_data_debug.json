Python's design is computer-science oriented (unlike languages like Perl, Ruby, Scheme or JavaScript), with a bias toward cohesiveness and readability. It has a relatively \"flat\" learning curve, due to its full implementation of object-oriented features, implicit declaration of mutable data types, and automatic memory management.",

According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, there were 564,708 people experiencing homelessness on a single night in 2017. This number has increased by 0.7% since 2016. The majority of homeless individuals are single adults (71%), and about one-third live in unsheltered locations.\nThe causes of homelessness are complex and vary from person to person. However, it is clear that many factors contribute to this issue. For example, lack of affordable housing is a major cause of homelessness. In fact, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates that more than 7 million low-income households pay more than half their income for rent and utilities. Additionally, the high cost of living in urban areas can make it difficult for low-income families to afford housing.\nAnother factor contributing to homelessness is mental illness. Approximately 20% of homeless individuals have a serious mental illness. Many of these individuals do not receive adequate treatment or support. As a result, they may be unable to maintain employment or housing.\nThere are several ways to help the homeless. First, we should provide them with safe shelter. Shelters provide food, clothing, and medical care. They also offer job training and counseling services. Second, we should provide them with permanent housing. Permanent housing provides stability and security. It allows individuals to focus on improving their lives. Finally, we should provide them with social services. Social services include education, healthcare, and job training. These services allow individuals to become self-sufficient.",

He also uses similes to compare one thing to another, such as when he compares Gatsby\u2019s eyes to \u201ctwo small blue caves\u201d.\nThis book is a great read for anyone interested in the Roaring Twenties or just looking for a good story.",

These features are learned using a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained end-to-end on a large dataset of images with manually annotated bounding boxes.

A state of total war emerged, directly involving more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. The major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, creating a technological breakthrough that resulted in total war. In the final year of the war, Allied forces launched an invasion of Germany, which ended the war in Europe on May 8, 1945. However, fighting continued in Asia, where Japan had been making war preparations for years prior. The war ended with the total defeat of Nazi Germany and the Japanese Empire.",

A Student will also have the same attributes as a Person but it will also have additional attributes like GPA, courses taken, etc. This means that you don't need to write all the code for a student again.

It is characterized by complete absorption in what one does, and a resulting loss in one's sense of space and time. In essence, flow is characterized by complete involvement and enjoyment in the process of the activity. Flow is often described as being \"in the zone\", as it can be seen as a form of synchronicity between the person and the task.\n\nThere are several factors that contribute to achieving flow. The first factor is having clear goals. Having clear goals allows for a person to know when they have achieved their goal, and thus gives them a way to measure success. Achieving these goals also contributes to intrinsic motivation, which is another factor that leads to flow. Intrinsic motivation comes from within the individual, and is not dependent on external rewards. This type of motivation is important because it allows an individual to continue to work towards their goals even if there are no external rewards.\n\nThe third factor that contributes to flow is feedback. Feedback allows a person to see how well they are performing, and thus allows them to adjust their behavior accordingly. If a person is receiving negative feedback, then they will know that they need to change something about their performance. However, if a person is receiving positive feedback, then they will know that they are performing well and should continue with their current behavior.",

I usually play with my friends on weekends. We often go to the park or playground to play. Basketball is a team sport, so we need to work together to win. I am a point guard, so I need to pass the ball to other players and make sure they can score. I also need to be able to shoot the ball into the basket. I love this game because it is exciting and fun.\nI started playing basketball when I was in middle school. My friend introduced me to the game. At first, I didn\u2019t know how to play, but I learned quickly. After a few months, I became good at shooting the ball. I could even dunk the ball! I played basketball every day after school. I practiced dribbling, passing, and shooting. I also worked hard to improve my skills. Now, I am a better player than before.",
